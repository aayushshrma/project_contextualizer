## Project Design and Approval Phase

**Plat Phase**

1. Owner/Developer contracts Surveyor for subdivision layout
2. Surveyor submits subdivision drawing sets to GIS to initiate the RPA review process
3. RPA Review Process involves applicable municipality/Utility reviews and approvals
4. RPA approval after receipt and incorporation of all requirements identified during Review Process
5. Plat Recorded – process requires signatures from municipality/utility

WWTA will keep one copy of all plats at the time of signing.

**Initial Sewer Design shall be approved in the following priority:** Gravity System, Gravity System to Pumping System, Low Pressure Grinder System, Low Pressure and any alternative system must be approved by the WWTA Board.

**WWTA General Notes for Sanitary Sewer Design:** Drawings must be included on submittals.

**Formula for Determining WWTA Sewer Plan Review Fee:**

1. Owner/Developer contracts Surveyor for sewer system design
2. Preliminary Sewer Design submitted to WWTA Submittal
3. Requirements for WWTA Submittal: Two sets of drawings, Flow Calculations
4. Project Number and Project Name Assigned by WWTA
5. WWTA issues Letter of Transmittal to engineer with marked up drawing set
6. Project review and drawing markup of two sets of drawings completed
7. One set of marked up drawings returned to Engineer
8. Engineer revises drawings and submits five sets to WWTA for Design and Construction approval
9. WWTA reviews submittal for final approval
10. WWTA issues Approval for Construction letter to Engineer
11. WWTA distributes Original approved drawing sets: 2 sets - Engineer, 1 set - State, 1 set - WWTA Central File

**Drawings approved and stamped** leads to **Easements Identified Initiate the Easement Process**.

**Easements Identified Initiate the Easement Process** leads to **Revisions are required** (loop back to **Engineer revises drawings and submits five sets to WWTA for Design and Construction approval**) or **Construction Start**.

## Preconstruction Phase

**MANDATORY Attendees at Preconstruction Meeting:** Owner/Developer Engineer, Surveyor, Contractor, WWTA Engineer, WWTA Manager, WWTA RPR.

Construction Contractors are required to be Municipal Utility (MUG) licensed and provide copy at preconstruction meeting.

**Attendees receive:** Copy of Preconstruction Notes outlining requirements and milestones throughout project construction.

**Owner/Developer provides completed Application for a public sewer extension to WWTA Engineer.**

**The Permit for a public sewer extension is completed by WWTA and provided to Owner/Developer to start construction.**

**Notice to Proceed** is issued.

**RPR receives two day notice of construction start.**

**WWTA sewer system tie-in point is plugged prior to Construction Start to protect existing WWTA sewer system during construction.**

**Engineer is responsible for performing construction administration.**

## Construction Phase

**WWTA RPR performs onsite inspection and collection of project data during construction.**

**All other site Utility construction completed prior to sewer construction completion.**

**Sewer construction completed and line testing started by WWTA RPR - manhole, tv, air.**

**Line testing passes** leads to **Pre-paving Walk Through**.

**Line testing fails** leads to **Punchlist developed to correct deficiencies found during testing**.

**Punchlist Items Corrected** leads to **Pre-paving Walk Through**.

**Pre-paving Walk Through** leads to **Walk Through Passes**.

**Walk Through requires punchlist** leads to **Punchlist Items Corrected**.

**Walk Through Passes** leads to **Hamilton County Engineering approves proceeding with paving**.

**Hamilton County Engineering approves proceeding with paving** leads to **Paving Completed**.

**Paving Completed** leads to **Post paving Walk Through**.

**Post paving Walk Through** leads to **Walk Through Passes**.

**Walk Through Passes** leads to **Construction Finish**.

**Construction Finish** leads to **WWTA RPR completes final inspection and reports – turns in all construction files to main office.**

**WWTA RPR completes final inspection and reports – turns in all construction files to main office.** leads to **WWTA mails to Owner/Developer Construction Approval Letter with final requirements for project close out forms.**

**WWTA mails to Owner/Developer Construction Approval Letter with final requirements for project close out forms.** leads to **Owner/Developer Final Documentation to submit for Project Completion:**

- One year warranty
- Inspection fee paid
- Certification of system value
- Easements recorded by plat or easement
- Record Drawing submittal
- Reset of system after other utilities are installed

## Project Close Out

**Resolution presented and accepted by WWTA Board to accept the extension to the WWTA sewer system.**

**Notification of Guaranty Warranty to Owner/Developer.**

**Record Drawing Submittal**

1. Surveyor/Engineer submits to WWTA two sets of Preliminary Final Record drawings compiled from data the contractor collected during construction.
2. WWTA RPR reviews and marks up one set of drawings and returns to administration.
3. HCE reviews one set of drawings for Drawing format, Presentation of data, Verify lot numbers, Verify addressing.
4. HCE compiles all changes onto one set of drawings.
5. HCE sends out Letter for Final Submittal of Record Drawing with markup enclosed.
6. WWTA receives mylar record drawing and autocad file.
7. HCE reviews record drawing submittal for accuracy and that autocad file is in state plane coordinates.

**Permitting Begins.**

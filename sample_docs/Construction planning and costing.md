### 3. Construction Schedule

#### 3.1. Preparation Construction • • • Preparation work: 3 months, Clearance: 3 months

##### (1) Preparation Construction • • • 3months

The following items including study items may be considered as preliminary works, and all items above should be implemented within three months.

1) Planning

2) Investigation

①Home investigation

②Well investigation

③Water sentence and groundwater investigation

3) Surveying

①Basic surveying (temporary B M, reference point setting)

②Construction surveying

##### (2) Clearance 3 months

#### 3.2. Existing roadbed Improvement work • • • 8 months

Improvement of existing roadbeds is carried out within sections that are severely damaged due to mud pumping.

##### (1) Target Extension

①Section A (between Lahat and Muara Enim) L=8,787m.

②Section C (between Prabumulih and Kertapati) L=19,324m.

③Total extension L=28,111m=28.1km. (Target Volume V=78,711m<sup>3</sup>)

##### (2) Term of Works

Construction rate is set to 20-30m/day/track per one party (10 manpower), i.e., 40 days per km.

N=28.1km×40days per km=1124 days, 1124 days per 30 days = 37.5 months.

When it is said that I spend 5 groups, 37.5 months per 5 groups ≈ 7.5 months.

→ 8.0 months.

#### 3.3. Track Rehabilitation Work

##### (1) Track Rehabilitation Work (Section A and Section B) • • • 21 months

Replacement of track material, replenishment of ballast, and the like within sections that are severely damaged.

1) Target Extension

①Section A (between Lahat and Muara Enim)  $L=38.07\text{km}$ .  
②Section B (between Muara Enim and Prabumulih)  $L=70.58\text{km}$ .  
③Total extension  $L=108.65\text{km}=108,650\text{m}$ .

2) Term of Works

Length to be actually improved may be considered to be about one third of a target length, but the schedule will be calculated based on the whole length due to the necessity of inspection over the whole length.

Construction rate is set to 30 m / day / track per one party (10 manpower), i.e., 30 days per km.

 $N=108.65\text{km}\times 30\text{ days per km}=3260\text{ days}$ .

 $3260\text{ days per } 30\text{ days}=108.7\text{ months}$ .

When it is said that I spend five groups,  $108.7\text{ months per } 5\text{ groups} \approx 21.7\text{ months}$ .

→ 21 months are required.

The same period will also be ensured within a critical path in the second phase, including possible repair.

(2) The 1st Stage Enforcement:R54 track exchange work (C section) • • • 27 months

Sleeper replacement work, which is included in track replacement works from R42 to R54, is carried out in advance.

1) Target Extension

• Section C (between Prabumulih X6 and Kertapati)  $L=80.6\text{km}$ .

2) Term of Works

Assuming that a train interval is 1.5 hours and 5 works per day are carried out, construction rate is set to 10-15 m/day/track per one party (10 manpower), i.e., 80 days per km.

Allocating one group per 10 km results in allocating eight groups as a whole.

Therefore, the work days,  $N=80.6\text{km}\times 80\text{days per km}=6448\text{days}$ ,

 $6448\text{ days per } 30\text{ days}=214.9\text{ months}$ ,  $214.9\text{ months per } 8\text{ groups}=26.9\text{ months}$ 

→ 27 months are required.

(3) The 2nd Stage Enforcement:R54 track exchange work(C section) • • • 21 months

Rail exchange work, which is included in track replacement works from R42 to R54, is carried out.

1) Target Extension

• Section C (between Prabumulih X6 and Kertapati)  $L=80.6\text{km}$ .

2) Term of Works

Since a critical path in the second phase consists of bridge work and track laying work in

construction works for double tracking (1) (B section), the schedule is set to 21 months of the period.

### 3.4. Improvement Work of Civil Engineering Facilities

The 1st stage 27 months, the 2nd stage 18 months, the 3rd stage 18 months.

#### (1) Improvement Work of Station Facilities

The 1st stage 27 months, the 2nd stage 18 months, the 3rd stage 18 months.

##### 1) The 1st Stage

( 400m, 4 places, Total extension  $L=58+175+263+58=554m$  )

There is few it for the work load, but the schedule is set during critical path 27 months because it is dotted.

##### 2) The 2nd stage

(700m, 6 places, Total extension  $L=207+239+300\times 4=1646m$ )

Because it does not become the critical path, the schedule is set it by a reason like the above in around 18 months.

##### 3) The 3rd stage

(1000m, 10 places, all out deferred extension  $L=294+300\times 8+339=3033m$ )

Because it does not become the critical path, the schedule is set around 18 months.

#### (2) Improvement and New Installation Work of Signal and Telecom Equipment

• • • 18 months.

##### 1) The 2nd Stage

(700m, 2 places of new establishments by for each one place of the section of A and C in total.

Total extension  $L=700+700=1400m$ )

Because it does not become the critical path, the schedule is set around 18 months.

##### 2) The 3rd stage (1000m, 2 places, Total Extension $L=300+300=600m$ )

Because it does not become the critical path, the schedule is set around 18 months.

### 3.5. Branch Line Construction between Merapi and Coal Storage Yard

Because it does not become the critical path, the schedule is set around 18 months.

### 3.6. Double Tracking

#### 3.6.1. Double Tracking (2), (3) :(Section A and C)

The 3rd stage (Target Extension  $27.54+80.6=108.14km$ )

### (1) Site Access Road

#### 1) Between Kertapati and Prabumulih

Because there is not the section concerned in the slip road apart from a national highway in a damp area part either, the road for construction is installed at 6.0m in width parallel to a plan line outside of a plan line.

In addition, because the basic ground is soft, the road for construction gives a soil stabilization by cement of 1.0m and does it with the structure that 1.0m extra earth laid on the ground did on the top.

- Site Access Road, Width=6.0m, Extension=20km.
- Soil Stabilization by Cement, Area= $6.0\text{m}\times 20,000\text{m}=120,000.0\text{m}^2$
- Embankment: Volume= $6.0\text{m}\times 1.0\text{m}\times 20000\text{m}=120,000.0\text{m}^3$  (purchase soil)
- Cost of Construction:  $M=2,500 \text{ yen per m}^3\times 120,000\text{m}^3+2300 \text{ yen per m}^2\times 120,000.0\text{m}^3$   
  =576,000,000 yen. (local cost)

→The cost of construction includes 50% in consideration of Indonesia and a Japanese price level.

$$=288,000,000 \text{ yen.}$$

(When We convert it as 1 yen = 110Rp, 26,180  $\div$  31,680 million Rp.) (local cost)

- Term of Works :  $N=120,000.0\text{m}^3$  per  $600\text{m}^3$  per day per / 5 groups +  $120,000\text{m}^3 / 200\text{m}^2$  per day / 5 groups = 160 days.

$$\div 5.0 \sim 6.0 \text{ months.}$$

#### 2) Between Muara Enim and Lahat

A national highway parallels the section concerned and because the ground is good, the road for construction uses a trajectory planning line to use in the future as a double track.

Therefore, it is the simple management and the road for construction shall include it in permanent work cost include it to easily for a cost of construction, term of works because the slip road formation is possible.

### (2) Ground Improvement Work

Double track section (Pyakabung - Kertapati interval) of 20.8km belongs to the damp ground part and carries out a ground improvement by the pile net method of construction because the basic ground is soft. (6m in width, extension 20.8km)

The construction speed assumes it  $150\text{m}^2$  per day (25m in depth) per one group, when spend five groups, the construction days is,

$$N= (6\text{m}\times 20800\text{m}) / (150\text{m}^2 \text{ per day}) \text{ per 5 groups} \div 166\text{days.}$$

→166days per 30days  $\div$  6 months →6 months are required.

2) Term of Works

① Track Bed

The track bed assumes two levels of finish by a motor grader, a road roller, the combination of tire rollers.

The quantity of construction assumes it  $1200\text{m}^3$  per day.

$$N=890,664\text{m}^2/1200\times 2=742 \text{ days}\times 2=1484 \text{ days}, 1484 \text{ days} / 30 \text{ days}=49 \text{ months}.$$

When I spend 8 groups, 49 months / 8 groups  $\approx$  6 months.

② Asphalt Pavement: coarse-graded asphalt concrete  $t=5\text{cm}$  (finish it still more)

It of a asphalt finisher, a road roller, a tire roller, the vibratory roller put together.

The quantity of construction per day assumes it  $2,300\text{m}^2$  per day.

$$N=890,664\text{m}^2\div 2300\text{m}^2=387\text{days}, 387\text{days}/30 \text{ days} \approx 13 \text{ months}.$$

## 2) Term of Work

Work is set to 20th per 1km. ( 50m / group per day )

The work days:  $N=118.677\text{km}\times 20\text{ days per km} \approx 2374\text{ days}$ .

 $2374\text{ days} / 30\text{ days}=79\text{ months}$ .

The work spends 9 groups and as a work condition, I assume it parallel work for roadbed construction and around three months.

 $8.8 - 3.0 \approx 6.0\text{ months}$ .

## 3.6.2. Double Tracking (1) (Section B), the 2nd Stage

### (1) Target Extension

The environmental group setting that the construction extension which PT.KAI enforces it alone is 70.58km a double track.

This work delays, and the doubtful situation includes the completion by the project enforcement concerned.

Therefore, I shall maintain the construction of non-enforcement section by the project concerned, and the maintenance extension intends for approximately 30km based on a field work result.

### (2) Term of Works

As for the extension of the double tracking the (2) (Section B) is approximately a one-third 30km a double track for the double tracking the (2) (Section A) and extension  $L=27.54+80.6=108.14\text{km}$  of the double tracking (2) (Section C).

Therefore, you should secure the term of works appropriate to the extension ratio basically.

A tall and stout bridge of bridge long 40-50m is that a 2 bridge exists in this section, and the critical path of the 1 work (Section B) is decided a double track in total 24 months for 18 months and track laying work three months for preparations work three months and the term of works of the bridge concerned.

In addition, the details schedule of work itemization includes in reference to the work process of the double tracking the (2) (Section A) and the double tracking the (2) (Section C) appropriately.

### 3.7. Installation of Additional Crossing

Because it cannot become the critical path, I find the term of works for around six months with the appearance that kept room in the work latter half.

### 3.8. Improvement and New Installation of Signal and Telecom Equipment

Because it cannot become the critical path as well as the above, I find the term of works for around 12 months with the appearance that kept room in the work latter half.

### 3.9. Improvement and New Installation of Electromechanical Equipment

Similarly, I find the term of works for around 12 months with the appearance that gave you room in the work latter half because it cannot become the critical path.

### 3.10. Reinforcement of Rolling Stock Repair Facility

Similarly, I find term of works of the degree with the appearance that gave you room in the construction latter half for 12-15 months because it cannot become the critical path.

### 3.11. Reinforcement of Loading and Unloading Equipment

Similarly, because it cannot become the critical path, give enough me room at the first, the second stage and find term of works and find 15 months for true term of works in the latter half at the third stage.

### 3.12. Rolling Stock Procurement (Locomotives and Wagons)

According to the past example and the maker hearing, 2-3 years are usually required. Therefore, I secure term of works appropriate to the procurement amount of each stage in the form that planned adjustment with the whole term of works during the period concerned.

### 3.13. The Site Acquisition and Inhabitants Move

We carry out environmental assessment (AMDAL) for one year from enforcement six years ago for the third stage to plan facilitation of the construction and carry out the site acquisition and inhabitants move afterwards for five years.

Diagram illustrating the cross-section of a steel sheet pile (IV form) used for excavation support. The diagram shows the relationship between the excavation dimensions (digging L direction, digging C direction) and the footing dimensions (footing L direction, footing C direction). The steel sheet pile IV form is shown inserted into the excavation.

Below the cross-section, a detailed elevation view of the steel sheet pile is provided, showing the profile of the sheet pile and the excavation depth (5000). The diagram also indicates the steel sheet pile IV form and the digging height.
